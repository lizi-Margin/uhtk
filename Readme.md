# 🧰 UHTK — Universal Hulc ToolKit

> A modular, reusable component library for rapid AI and simulation development.

---

## 🌍 Overview

**UHTK (Universal Hulc ToolKit)** is a **component-driven development repository** — a unified collection of reusable modules and utilities extracted from real projects.  
Instead of rewriting the same functionality across different experiments or prototypes, you can simply **clone this repo once** and instantly access a rich set of ready-to-use components.

This toolkit evolves continuously as more utilities and subsystems are extracted from ongoing projects.

## 📦 Included Components (to be updated)

### Core Modules
- **3dutils** — Common 3D geometry and transformation utilities  
- **siri utils** — General-purpose helpers (`utils`, `vision`)  
- **mcv_log_manager.py** — Unified logging and experiment tracking  
- **imitation** — Dataset I/O, screen grabber, and trajectory tools  
- **zh_font** — Simplified Chinese font integration for visualization  

### C++ Tools
- **csv_drawer** — CSV-based data visualizer  
- **rubish_can** — A playground for experimental or legacy C++ code

## 🚀 Upcoming Features

- **RNN-based policy framework** — Sequential decision modeling  
- **Transformer-based policy framework** — Scalable high-level reasoning

## 💡 Development Philosophy

UHTK follows a **component-oriented development philosophy**:
> Every piece of functionality that proves reusable should become an independent, well-defined component.

This approach allows any future project to be bootstrapped instantly using existing building blocks.  
Simply clone the repository, import what you need, and start building.

## 🧩 Vision

To grow UHTK into a **universal backbone library** for AI, robotics, and simulation —  
a place where reusable ideas, algorithms, and utilities converge into a coherent ecosystem.
